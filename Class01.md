## READING NOTES:
Markdown is a way to style text on GitHub.  Here are some ways to style code using Markdown:

###Inline Code:
wrap your inline code in backticks: `var example = true`.  To use syntax highlighting, include the language in parenthesis ()

##Longer Blocks of Code:
indent with four spaces:
        Javascript
        if (isAwesome){
        return true
        }
        
###Task Lists:
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

###Tables:
In order to create a table, you can assemnble a list of words and divide them with hyphens for the first row, and then separate each coloumn with a pipe |:
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
