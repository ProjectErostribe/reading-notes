# CODE 102 READING NOTES

## PERSONAL INTRODUCTION:
My name is Paidamoyo-Janet Azehko, but most people call me MYLES. I decided to learn to code when one of my favourite DJ's (Benji Vaugh, also known as Prometheus) retired to start a tech company (Disciple Media).  After beta testing the product (the Simon Posford app), I decided that I too would be an artist gone techie.

I found my way to volunteering for TechInclusion, a San Francisco based non-profit that works to get underprivilged and underrepresented people into the tech industry.

Other than learning to code, I am founder of Project Erostribe, a creative agency that does everything from design sustainable motorcycle gear, to develop apps that help non-verbal persons on the autism spectrum communicate and organise their lives.  (www.projecterostribe.com)

My favorite drink is a matcha latte, and in my spare time I can be found dreaming up a return to Shpongleland.

## GROWTH MINDSET:
A growth mindset is the ability to learn from setbacks.  Most people think that learning is something that happens when you're getting all the answers right, but in my experience, real learning and growth comes when things aren't making sense and you have to connect the dots.

I want to remind myself that I started learning to code a year ago, and 3 months ago I had a sustained a brain injury.  Things take time, and as long as I pay attention and try to connect the dots and learn new things I will be learning something that will provide a good life for myself if I just keep working at it everyday.

In the words of Delmer Eugene Croft:
> "Make your purpose brilliant.  Keep it clear.  Seek to energise it with positives."
